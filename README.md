# Light_sensing_dimmer
Anti-flickering light-sensing LED dimmer

Working well, but needs a bit tidying up.

## Next: 
- to make an LED class, for scalability, containing the LED variables, all of them public... Kinda done, but needs testing.
- to make a header/library for the project. Kinda done, but needs testing.
- to refactor the functions to take parameters, not assume global variables. Kinda done, but needs testing.
- implement class and refactored funcions in main.cpp
- make TinkerCAD simulation and drawing
- add doxygen
- add github pages
