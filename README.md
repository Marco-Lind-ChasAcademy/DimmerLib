# Light_sensing_dimmer
Anti-flickering light-sensing LED dimmer

Working well, but needs a bit tidying up.

## Next: 
- to make an LED class, for scalability, containing the LED variables, all of them public...
- to make a header/library for the project
- to refactor the functions to take parameters, not assume global variables
